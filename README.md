# Streamlit Web Applications

In this repo I've collected my files for creating an interactive web application using the Jena climate dataset. This repository is designed to provide a seamless experience for exploring and analyzing the Jena climate data.

The main components of this project are:

 *   Test File: This file is used for testing and experimenting with the Python code without affecting the primary application.
 *   Jena Climate Dataset: The jena_climate_2009_2016.csv file contains the full dataset provided by Kaggle, which serves as the foundation for our analysis.
 *   Prediction CSV Files: The test_predictions.csv, train_predictions.csv, and validation_predictions.csv files store the pre-computed predictions, allowing for efficient data loading in the web application.
 *   Climate App: The climate_app.py file is the main script that runs the Streamlit-based web application.

The purpose of this project is to create an engaging and informative web application that allows users to interact with the Jena climate data. By pre-computing the predictions and storing them in CSV files, we can ensure a responsive and efficient user experience, without the need to train or generate predictions within the web application itself.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to help fellow developers and enthusiasts in their data exploration endeavors.
